## 5. Navigation

Description : Building a remote control architecture for users to communicate and control using only their brain activity.  we are making framework and GUI for BCI(Brain Computer Interface)

## 6. Social navigation

Description : Semantic mapping for Human-Robot Interaction. We use [aruco_ros](https://github.com/pal-robotics/aruco_ros) for recognizing some objects. Then, we get a common sense about this objects on [ConceptNet](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/API) and add location' attribute on the map.

## 7. Dialog gathering system for social conversation

Description : A system that automatically acquires dialogue data from multiple users through Google form. The system works through the interaction of the automation server and the Google API. Currently, it is still under development but we are going to add social factors such as the situation of the dialogue in the near future.
